## Dynamix v2.0.8

#### Update

*Dynamix webGui has been updated to version 2.0.8. Thanks to the support of the unRAID community a number of fixes and improvements are introduced. See the folder "changes" for a list of what has been changed, including changes in the optional plugins. All users of earlier versions are encouraged to upgrade to this version.*


#### Introduction

Dynamix webGui is a dynamic webGui for unRAID systems with enhanced features and optional add-ons.

Dynamix webGui is the next step in the evolution of the original SimpleFeatures enhanced webGui for unRAID systems.
Its goal is to have pages dynamically updated and watch the operation of your unRAID server in real-time.

Dynamix webGui offers a number of improvements not available before:

- Real-time page updates, the status view of your array is always up-to-date.
- Tabbed viewing, more efficient use of the available screen area, scrolling is hardly required.
- Improved visibility, better readibility and consistency of the sans-serif and monospace fonts in different browsers.
- Improved operability, no more accidental cancellations or wrong button clicking.
- Fully compatible with unRAID OS v5.0.

Dynamix webGui completely replaces the stock unRAID GUI which comes with version 5.0 or the enhanced Limetech webGui on github.

Do **not** use Dynamix webGui on any earlier versions of unRAID other then 5.0 - including the earlier RC candidates.

Do **not** run Dynamix in conjunction with the Limetech enhanced webGui, these are not compatible.

Do **not** mix Dynamix and SimpleFeatures plugins, these are not compatible.

Dynamix webGui requires an up-to-date browser version. It has been tested with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

#### Download warning

*DO NOT DOWNLOAD FILES DIRECTLY FROM THE FOLDERS 'DOWNLOAD' OR 'PLUGINS' BUT USE THE LINKS PROVIDED IN THIS 'README.MD' FILE INSTEAD.*

#### Installation

*This describes a first time installation, if you are upgrading from an older version, see the section 'Upgrading'.*

Dynamix webGui is considered a system plugin and is installed in the folder `/boot/plugins`.
This ensures it gets installed first, before any other plugins, and the correct environment is created upfront.

- Login to the command line on your server, e.g., at the console or a telnet session.
- Create the directory `/boot/plugins` directory, if it is not existing.
- Type the below:

```
cd /boot/plugins
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/bergware/dynamix/master/plugins/dynamix.webGui-2.0.8-noarch-bergware.plg
```

- Alternatively: [![](/download/dynamix.webGui.png)](https://raw.github.com/bergware/dynamix/master/plugins/dynamix.webGui-2.0.8-noarch-bergware.plg) (right-click and select "save link as")

- Reboot your server to start with a *clean* webGui environment.
- You may need to clear your Browser's cache for correct viewing.

#### Screenshots

The main screen shows the different devices in separate tabs. The current screen is updated in real-time. Click on the tab header to move between screens.

The operation of the array (e.g. parity-check) can be viewed in real-time as well. When a parity-check is ongoing the statusbar at the bottom shows the current status in any screen. Note also the disabling of buttons to avoid accidental mis-clicking!

Settings are logically grouped. This not only removes the clutter of a busy screen, but makes it also easier to find your way.

Monospace font is made more readable, both for main screen and popup screens.

The Browser function has been rewritten for improved speed and visibility of duplicate files. These are clearly indicated by displaying them in orange.

The optional "plugin control" module allows for easy installation, updating and uninstallation of all of the available Dynamix plugins via the GUI. This way maintaining your plugins becomes a breeze!
